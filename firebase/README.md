The firebase-arduino library uses the Arduino-Json library. The Arduino-Json library is written and maintained by 
Beno√Æt Blanchon and is available at https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson. 

We have included the Arduino-JSON library as a part of the firebase library itself to ensure compatibility with the 
version we are using for the ThingsPing kits. 

The Arduino-JSON has been released under MIT license, another permissive license.
